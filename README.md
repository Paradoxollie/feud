# Family Feud
Fun friends and family game voluntarily created for Engineering Week for Northrop Grumman.

## Project Overview
A family feud game featuring a moderator view and a contestant view. Families compete to name the most popular responses to survey questions in order to win cash and prizes. The moderator panel can control the sounds, effects, answers, points and questions. The families will be able to have a fun oriented game taking turns naming answers. When the family gets the correct answer, they will earn points on the board. Three strikes, you're out! After three strikes, the other family gets to steal the points. Have fun!
